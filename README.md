# Getting Started with WEBEX Chrome Extension

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
But it will be in the size of chrome extension Only.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Include into extensions

**Note: Make sure that you have turned on the developer Mode**

If you aren't turned on the developer Mode open the extension menu page and in the right corner you can turn on the developer mode.

Then in the left corner click the load unpacked and select the `build` folder

Now you can see the webex in the extensions list and if you need pin it.

## improvements need to be done

Need to implement the baxkground file to create a worker from page to extension

With the help of background file need to implement the storage facility for the extension
